Hi I am trying to learn git...
First I used "mkdir" to create a directory and used "git clone" to clone one of my global/central repository
Second I created a text file by "touch file.txt" and I will commit the this file using "git commit"
After git commit:
first click "I" to enable insert mode and next to come out of the window press "esc" key and "shift + ;" and "w" "q" (write and quit)
Authority identity:
  git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"
  git config --global user.name "name"
Default identity: omit --global
